# data-sourcing-challenge

This is an UNC-Chapel Hill AI Boot Camp assignment for Module 6. This assignment prepares data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. It extracts data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.
